\section{Peterson revisited}
Recall the \verb|PetersonNaive| 2-threaded starvation-free lock algorithm introduced in Section \ref{sec:PetersonLock}. It doesn't work in practice, despite our proof of correctness. To show this, consider the following experiment (in code block \ref{code:naive_peterson_experiment}): write a simple program where two threads repeatedly acquire the \verb|PetersonNaive| lock, increment a shared counter, and release the lock. If each thread does this acquire-increment-release process, say 500,000 times, then the counter should read 1,000,000 at the end. Let's see what happens in practice.

\begin{verbatim}
#include "Peterson.hpp"

int main() {
    int counter = 0;
    PetersonNaive mutex;

    auto f = [&mutex, &counter]() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 500000; i++) {
            mutex.lock();
            counter++;
            mutex.unlock();
        }
    };

    std::thread thread1(f);
    std::thread thread2(f);

    thread1.join();
    thread2.join();

    std::cout << "Final result: " << counter <<  std::endl;
    return 0;
}
\end{verbatim}
\captionof{Code}{If PetersonNaive provided mutual exclusion as expected, then the output should be 1000000. However, I got 988,495 (exact output may vary from run to run).}
