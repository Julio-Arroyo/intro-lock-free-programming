# intro-lock-free-programming

## Approach
Take a practical approach to lock-free programming. Learn theory in so
far it promotes fundamental, conceptual understanding. Main focus is implementation. Avoid unnecessarily formal proofs.

## Objectives:
- Read Chapters 1,2,3,7,9,10
- Write 'lecture notes' synthesizing main ideas, and replacing textbook's Java examples with C++20.
- Work through some end of chapter exercises.
- Implement high-performance lock-free queue.
    - Specific flavor TBD: SPMC, MPMC, ...
    - Avoiding false sharing problem.
